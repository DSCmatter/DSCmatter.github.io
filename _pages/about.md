I’m a CS undergrad at MITS, India and also SWE Intern @ Metry AI. Still figuring a few things out as I go. When I’m not working on tech, I’m usually gaming or reading fantasy novels. (=_=;)

Lately, I’ve been exploring open source, AWS, and algorithms—though [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/u/MyNightmare/) isn’t really my thing. (｡•́︿•̀｡) 

You can find me on GitHub as [DSCmatter](https://github.com/DSCmatter) feel free to reach out on any social if you want to chat or just say hi ദ്ദി(˵ •̀ ᴗ - ˵ ) ✧
