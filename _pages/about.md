An IT undergrad @ MITS from India, soon to be a Junior. Currently, I’m diving into backend development, software engineering, ML/AI and some-cloud using C++/Python/JavaScript/Go. Outside coding, I enjoy gaming, reading fantasy novels.

I’m also exploring open source, AWS, and algorithms (though Leetcode isn’t my favorite). Find me on GitHub as [`DSCmatter`](https://github.com/DSCmatter) and feel free to reach out through any socials, if you want to chat tech or just say hi! ദ്ദി(˵ •̀ ᴗ - ˵ ) ✧
