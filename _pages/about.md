I’m a student exploring the world of CS. I’m still early in the journey and learning by building and doing and whatnot.

Outside of work, I enjoy gaming and reading fantasy novels, and I’ve also written a [novel](https://www.scribblehub.com/series/742017/thousand-eons-of-world/) myself. Lately, I’ve been spending more time with open source and brushing up on algorithms—[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/u/MyNightmare/) included, even if it’s not my favorite path.

Most of my work lives on GitHub under the name [DSCmatter](https://github.com/DSCmatter), and I’m always open to conversations, ideas, or collaboration. I also keep a separate [blog](https://dscmatter.github.io/blog/) where I write more about my thoughts and experiments.
