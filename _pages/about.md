From the ledger of the present age:

I walk the early path of computation, a student of the craft, and serve in season currently as a Software engineer. (⌐■_■) Much remains unwritten before me, and I learn by forward motion rather than certainty.

When the engines rest, I turn to other realms—contests of skill within gaming and chronicles of fantasy where old powers still breathe through ink and myth. I have also set ink to page myself, and written a [novel](https://www.scribblehub.com/series/742017/thousand-eons-of-world/). ( .. )φ

In recent cycles, I have set my gaze upon open source and the study of algorithms. The trials of [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/u/MyNightmare/), lie before me, though they are not the road I favor. ( ￣ ￣ )

My works are gathered under the name [DSCmatter](https://github.com/DSCmatter) in the halls of GitHub. Those who wish to speak, exchange ideas, or simply signal their presence may do so freely. ദ്ദി(˵ •̀ ᴗ - ˵ ) ✧

There is also another record of my thoughts and experiments, kept apart on a [blog](https://dscmatter.github.io/blog/), for those inclined to read further.
