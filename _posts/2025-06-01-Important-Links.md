I thought going through a lot of bookmarks was tiresome — so here we are.  
Below is a curated list of useful links, sorted by category. Save for later or share with friends who might need them.
This list will be updated regularly as soon as I find something more.

These lists have helped me personally, so I can vouch for their reliability.
