<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <p>This is where it all began.Our ancestors needed some way — a document, really — to verify a candidate’s abilities and determine whether they were eligible for a job.So they came up with what we now know as a CV or Resume.Now, having a good or bad resume doesn’t necessarily define a candidate’s worth — but it does help assess whether they might be capable of doing the job.In essence, a resume is just a filtering tool — used to weed out most candidates in what’s known as the initial screening stage.Once that filter does its job, the remaining candidates are contacted via email by HR, usually to schedule interviews and evaluate their skills more directly.After a few interviews, you might get the offer&amp;mldr;Or you might get rejected in the final round&amp;mldr;Or the company might cancel the entire hiring process altogether.We never know.But what can we do?Well — we shut up, and just keep applying. Keep interviewing. Keep showing up.It’s a long, tiring process. Sometimes it takes a month or two, depending on the company.Big companies, especially, receive thousands of applications for a single role.And for senior positions?Yeah&amp;mldr; we don’t talk about that.Let’s focus on Intern/Fresher roles:Here are some resume tips I personally vouch for.(Some people might have different opinions — and that’s okay. The goal is to read, think, and decide what works for you.)That said&amp;mldr;Think of this as your no-fluff crash course on crafting a resume that actually gets noticedLet’s break it down.What kind of job do you want to get? Front-end Web? Back-end Web? Enterprise applications? a job in C++ building databases? games industry?Each job roles requires different set of skills or a overalp can occur most likely in tech.So it’s important to know what someone’s hoping for and to tailor accordingly.What sort of position are you hoping to get?Intern, Junior, Senior, Director?Find what you are passionate about.Like to do Youtube? Finance? Tech? or perhaps you just love money?Try to reduce the verbosity of the resume, even if it makes it look more sparse – people will skim this only. Words you don’t need mean the words you want them to read are less likely to be what they see.Fewer but better projects beats greater in number but lesser in variety, If you have 8 projects, don’t list them all on a resume –makes it too busy.Trimming out certain things that the audience(HR) knowsyour target audience knows what these things are and doesn’t need to be told:For example:Try to quantify if you can but don’t put uneccessary numbers;Use STAR methodology if possible –LinkBe bold. Don’t be afraid to have blank spaceOrder of sections matter:Include any kind of experience –better than having not at all.Don’t explain well known terms as filler words.Keep boldiing consistent or rather not have any bolding at all.A lot of people will tell you to do that sort of thing, and to add numbers everywhere “improved by X%!” (as I did but keep it realistic), any human seeing your resume will immediately be exasperated by it.Sure it looks good though.As an intern or graduate, we look for coachability / willingness to learn, and we try to gauge the applicant’s enthusiasm for CS as well as just how intelligent they are (basically the gradient we expect them to be on / how fast we think they will learn).If we give you a problem in an interview, and you blitz through it but don’t listen to the interviewer trying to prod you, you did worse than someone who was less confident but that was engaging in discussion well.In an interview, take time to understand the problem clearly.If it’s unfamiliar, don’t panic — explain what you do understand, try to reason through it, and don’t hesitate to ask the interviewer for hints.(It’s okay to not know everything — it’s not a stupidity contest 😊)This list will be continuously updated.
